# Portable-PSU

*In this project I tried to overcome a very common issue while working on a portable electronics project. That is how to power my circuits*

*This project is fully Open Source and you are free to use/modify it according to your choice*

- This is a tiny and compact portable Power supply module that runs on 2 18650 li-ion battery. 
- It has separated output for 3.3v, 5v and an adjustable voltage output. You can turn on or off each outputs individually. 
- On the board there are pin headers, screw terminals and barrel DC connecter which you can use to get those output voltages. 
- We have both USB type-C and micro USB port for charging. and also there is a 5v USB out as well. 
- On top of that we can use 6v solar cells to charge the battery and we can get the current battery voltage(3.3v compatible) and input charging voltage/state readings.
